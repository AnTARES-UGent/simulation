Currently, there are some problems with the simulation that lead to no output being displayed.
When in debug-mode, and verbose=True inside flight.py, you can see the current simulated time go up 1.87s, and the delta-time goes to 0.

These were the websites where I got all the data. I'd try those 4 motors from Cesaroni on Thrustcurve.org, and you can find the
